civi-private-event-settings
===========================

This extension will add a check box -> "Is members only event" and a Drupal permission "Can register for Members only events". If the "Is members only event" tick box is ticked, only a user with the "Can register for Members only events" can register for the Civi CRM Event.

An duration check option is added in Administer menu to enable and disable the validation of membership duration.

Online registration needs to be enabled, when creating the Event in Civi CRM.
